IcedCoffee
==========

IcedCoffee is a really simple slideshow program. Included is my talk on CoffeeScript from the 2010 April ElProg talk.

It's really not that great (written on the world's shortest deadline), but it was written with the intent
of learning some of the cooler language features of CoffeeScript.

To run it:

    git clone git://github.com/chrisdickinson/icedcoffee.git
    cd icedcoffee
    coffee --compile coffee/* -o js/
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    open "http://localhost:8000/slide1"

Click moves the slideshow forward, shift+click moves it backward (in theory).
